        # we need to create login menu, password, username
        # upon creating the package, we could ask if we want to assign for delivery straight away

        # a truck needs to be assigned also

        # we need to implement the time/date shit
        # we could make the app more interactive, like we could have a list of commands that opens when you start the app and then each command could have subcommands like in Search Delivery Route

        # we probably need some command to log in as admin etc and make the check who can perform which action

        # check if package weight etc, package status

        # prices

        # check if any truck is available for a given time period

        #create roles -   ADMIN = "Admin"
    SUPERVISOR = "Supervisor"
    EMPLOYEE = "Employee" - Log/in/out
